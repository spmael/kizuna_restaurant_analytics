## üí° Usage Examples

### Basic Cost Analysis
```python
from datetime import date, timedelta
from apps.analytics.services.cost_analytics import CostAnalyticsService

# Initialize service
cost_service = CostAnalyticsService()

# Set date range (last 30 days)
end_date = date.today()
start_date = end_date - timedelta(days=30)

# Get comprehensive cost overview
overview = cost_service.get_cost_overview(start_date, end_date)

if "error" not in overview:
    print(f"Food Cost: {overview['percentage_metrics']['food_cost_percentage']:.1f}%")
    print(f"Waste Cost: {overview['percentage_metrics']['waste_cost_percentage']:.1f}%")
    print(f"Performance Grade: {overview['performance_analysis']['overall_performance']['grade']}")
```

### Cost Trend Analysis
```python
from apps.analytics.utils.cost_utils import CostUtils

# Calculate cost trends
trend = CostUtils.calculate_cost_trend(start_date, end_date, "food_cost_percentage")

if "error" not in trend:
    print(f"Trend: {trend['trend']}")
    print(f"Change: {trend['change_percentage']:.1f}%")
```

### Cost Alerts
```python
# Generate cost alerts
alerts = cost_service.get_cost_alerts(start_date, end_date)

if "error" not in alerts:
    summary = alerts['summary']
    print(f"Critical Alerts: {summary['critical_count']}")
    print(f"Warning Alerts: {summary['warning_count']}")
    
    # Show critical alerts
    for alert in alerts['alerts']['critical']:
        print(f"üö® {alert['message']}")
```

### Recipe Profitability Analysis
```python
# Analyze recipe costs
recipes = cost_service.get_recipe_cost_analysis(start_date, end_date)

if "error" not in recipes:
    for recipe in recipes['recipes'][:5]:  # Top 5 recipes
        print(f"{recipe['recipe_name']}: {recipe['profit_margin']:.1f}% margin")
```

## üîß Utility Functions

### Cost Calculations
```python
from apps.analytics.utils.cost_utils import CostUtils

# Calculate percentages
food_cost_pct = CostUtils.calculate_food_cost_percentage(food_cost, revenue)
waste_cost_pct = CostUtils.calculate_waste_cost_percentage(waste_cost, revenue)
profit_margin = CostUtils.calculate_profit_margin(revenue, total_cost)

# Calculate efficiency score
efficiency = CostUtils.calculate_cost_efficiency_score(food_cost_pct, waste_cost_pct)
```

### Formatting
```python
# Format currency and percentages
formatted_cost = CostUtils.format_currency(amount, "FCFA")
formatted_pct = CostUtils.format_percentage(value, 1)

# Get status indicators
status = CostUtils.get_cost_status(food_cost_percentage)

from apps.analytics.services.cost_analytics import CostAnalyticsService

# Get both revenue and cost analysis
revenue_service = RevenueAnalyticsService()
cost_service = CostAnalyticsService()

revenue_overview = revenue_service.get_revenue_overview(start_date, end_date)
cost_overview = cost_service.get_cost_overview(start_date, end_date)

# Calculate net profit
net_profit = revenue_overview['total_metrics']['total_revenue'] - cost_overview['total_metrics']['total_food_cost']
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Configuration

### Customizing Benchmarks
Modify the `COST_BENCHMARKS` in `CostAnalyticsService` or `CostUtils`:

```python
COST_BENCHMARKS = {
    "food_cost_targets": {
        "excellent": (25, 30),  # Adjust for your restaurant
        "good": (30, 35),
        # ... customize as needed
    }
}
```

### Alert Thresholds
Customize alert thresholds in the service methods:

```python
# In get_cost_alerts method
food_cost_threshold = 40.0  # Customize threshold
waste_cost_threshold = 5.0   # Customize threshold
```
